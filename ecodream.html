                            <h2>The Fast Fashion Problem</h2>
                            <p>Today's fashion industry is dominated by fast fashion, which prioritizes mass production over quality. 
                                This leads to overconsumption as buyers are tempted by frequent new collections. This cycle harms the environment through excessive resource use and raises ethical concerns about factory working conditions. </p>

                        <div class="row-2 reveal">
                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            <h2>Ecodream's Vision for Sustainable Fashion</h2>
                            <p>To combat the prevalence of fast fashion, we aim to boost the visibility and reputation of Ecodream as a sustainable clothing option. 
                                Our strategy involves targeted efforts to raise awareness of the brand and emphasize the benefits of sustainable fashion. 
                                We'll focus on crafting an authentic and transparent message that resonates with environmentally conscious consumers.</p>

                            <h3>How it went</h3>
                            <h2>Enhancing User Experience and Accessibility</h2>
                            <p>In this project, the initial steps involved analyzing the Ecodream website to identify design flaws affecting user experience, such as long information pages, non-intuitive purchase process and a confusing site structure.
                                A focus was also placed on accessibility for users with disabilities. A competitive analysis followed, providing insights into the market and highlighting opportunities for Ecodream to stand out. 
                                Extensive user research was conducted, mainly through surveys, to understand the target audience's needs, behaviors, and preferences. 
                                This research led to the creation of user personas, guiding the design of adaptable wireframes for desktop and mobile, aiming for a consistent and intuitive user experience. 
                                The development of the user interface prioritized visual consistency, usability, and accessibility. User testing on interactive prototypes was essential for gathering feedback and refining the design. 
                                The project culminated in a final prototype that enhanced user experience and aligned with Ecodream's business goals.</p>
